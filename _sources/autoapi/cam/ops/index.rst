.. py:class:: threadCom(o, proc)

   .. py:attribute:: opname


   .. py:attribute:: outtext
      :value: ''



   .. py:attribute:: proc


   .. py:attribute:: lasttext
      :value: ''



.. py:function:: threadread(tcom)

   Reads the standard output of a background process in a non-blocking
   manner.

   This function reads a line from the standard output of a background
   process associated with the provided `tcom` object. It searches for a
   specific substring that indicates progress information, and if found,
   extracts that information and assigns it to the `outtext` attribute of
   the `tcom` object. This allows for real-time monitoring of the
   background process's output without blocking the main thread.

   :param tcom: An object that has a `proc` attribute with a `stdout`
                stream from which to read the output.
   :type tcom: object

   :returns:

             This function does not return a value; it modifies the `tcom`
                 object in place.
   :rtype: None


.. py:function:: timer_update(context)

   Monitor background processes related to camera path calculations.

   This function checks the status of background processes that are
   responsible for calculating camera paths. It retrieves the current
   processes and monitors their state. If a process has finished, it
   updates the corresponding camera operation and reloads the necessary
   paths. If the process is still running, it restarts the associated
   thread to continue monitoring.

   :param context: The context in which the function is called, typically
                   containing information about the current scene and operations.

      and adjusts the index of the active operation accordingly. If the active
      operation index becomes negative, it resets it to zero to ensure it
      remains within valid bounds.

      :param context: The context in which the operation is executed.

      :returns:

                A dictionary indicating the execution status, typically
                    containing {'FINISHED'} upon successful completion.
      :rtype: dict



.. py:function:: fixUnits()

   Set up units for BlenderCAM.

   This function configures the unit settings for the current Blender
   scene. It sets the rotation system to degrees and the scale length to
   1.0, ensuring that the units are appropriately configured for use within
   BlenderCAM.


.. py:class:: CamOperationAdd

   Bases: :py:obj:`bpy.types.Operator`


   Add New CAM Operation


   .. py:attribute:: bl_idname
      :value: 'scene.cam_operation_add'



   .. py:attribute:: bl_label
      :value: 'Add New CAM Operation'

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Execute the camera operation based on the active object in the scene.

      This method retrieves the active object from the Blender context and
      performs operations related to camera settings. It checks if an object
      is selected and retrieves its bounding box dimensions. If no object is
      found, it reports an error and cancels the operation. If an object is
      present, it adds a new camera operation to the scene, sets its
      properties, and ensures that a machine area object is present.

      :param context: The context in which the operation is executed.



.. py:class:: CamOperationCopy

   Bases: :py:obj:`bpy.types.Operator`


   Copy CAM Operation


   .. py:attribute:: bl_idname
      :value: 'scene.cam_operation_copy'



   .. py:attribute:: bl_label
      :value: 'Copy Active CAM Operation'



   .. py:attribute:: bl_options


   .. py:method:: poll(context)
      :classmethod:



   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Execute the camera operation in the given context.

      This method handles the execution of camera operations within the
      Blender scene. It first checks if there are any camera operations
      available. If not, it returns a cancellation status. If there are
      operations, it copies the active operation, increments the active
      operation index, and updates the name and filename of the new operation.
      The function also ensures that the new operation's name is unique by
      appending a copy suffix or incrementing a numeric suffix.

      :param context: The context in which the operation is executed.

      :returns:

                A dictionary indicating the status of the operation,
                    either {'CANCELLED'} if no operations are available or
                    {'FINISHED'} if the operation was successfully executed.
      :rtype: dict



.. py:class:: CamOperationRemove

   Bases: :py:obj:`bpy.types.Operator`


   Remove CAM Operation


   .. py:attribute:: bl_idname
      :value: 'scene.cam_operation_remove'



   .. py:attribute:: bl_label
      :value: 'Remove CAM Operation'



   .. py:attribute:: bl_options


   .. py:method:: poll(context)
      :classmethod:



   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Execute the camera operation in the given context.

      This function performs the active camera operation by deleting the
      associated object from the scene. It checks if there are any camera
      operations available and handles the deletion of the active operation's
      object. If the active operation is removed, it updates the active
      operation index accordingly. Additionally, it manages a dictionary that
      tracks hidden objects.

      :param context: The Blender context containing the scene and operations.
      :type context: bpy.context

      :returns:

                A dictionary indicating the result of the operation, either
                    {'CANCELLED'} if no operations are available or {'FINISHED'} if the
                    operation was successfully executed.
      :rtype: dict



.. py:class:: CamOperationMove

   Bases: :py:obj:`bpy.types.Operator`


   Move CAM Operation


   .. py:attribute:: bl_idname
      :value: 'scene.cam_operation_move'



   .. py:attribute:: bl_label
      :value: 'Move CAM Operation in List'

   .. py:attribute:: direction
      :type:  EnumProperty(name='Direction', items=(('UP', 'Up', ''), ('DOWN', 'Down', '')), description='Direction', default='DOWN')


   .. py:method:: poll(context)
      :classmethod:



   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Execute a camera operation based on the specified direction.

      This method modifies the active camera operation in the Blender context
      based on the direction specified. If the direction is 'UP', it moves the
      active operation up in the list, provided it is not already at the top.
      Conversely, if the direction is not 'UP', it moves the active operation
      down in the list, as long as it is not at the bottom. The method updates
      the active operation index accordingly.

      :param context: The context in which the operation is executed.

      :returns: A dictionary indicating the operation has finished, with
                the key 'FINISHED'.
      :rtype: dict



.. py:class:: CamOrientationAdd

   Bases: :py:obj:`bpy.types.Operator`


   Add Orientation to CAM Operation, for Multiaxis Operations


   .. py:attribute:: bl_idname

   .. py:attribute:: bl_label
      :value: 'Add Orientation'



   .. py:attribute:: bl_options


   .. py:method:: poll(context)
      :classmethod:



   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Execute the camera orientation operation in Blender.

      This function retrieves the active camera operation from the current
      scene, creates an empty object to represent the camera orientation, and
      adds it to a specified group. The empty object is named based on the
      operation's name and the current count of objects in the group. The size
      of the empty object is set to a predefined value for visibility.

      :param context: The context in which the operation is executed.

      :returns:

                A dictionary indicating the operation's completion status,
                    typically {'FINISHED'}.
      :rtype: dict



.. py:class:: CamBridgesAdd

   Bases: :py:obj:`bpy.types.Operator`


   Add Bridge Objects to Curve


   .. py:attribute:: bl_idname
