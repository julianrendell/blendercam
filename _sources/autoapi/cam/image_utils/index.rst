   Save a NumPy array as an image file in OpenEXR format.

   This function converts a NumPy array into an image and saves it using
   Blender's rendering capabilities. It sets the image format to OpenEXR
   with black and white color mode and a color depth of 32 bits. The image
   is saved to the specified filename.

   :param a: The NumPy array to be converted and saved as an image.
   :type a: numpy.ndarray
   :param iname: The file path where the image will be saved.

.. py:function:: getCircle(r, z)

   Generate a 2D array representing a circle.

   This function creates a 2D NumPy array filled with a specified value for
   points that fall within a circle of a given radius. The circle is
   centered in the array, and the function uses the Euclidean distance to
   determine which points are inside the circle. The resulting array has
   dimensions that are twice the radius, ensuring that the entire circle
   fits within the array.

   :param r: The radius of the circle.
   :type r: int
   :param z: The value to fill the points inside the circle.
   :type z: float

   :returns: A 2D array where points inside the circle are filled

   :rtype: None


.. py:function:: getOffsetImageCavities(o, i)

   Detects areas in the offset image which are 'cavities' due to curvature
   changes.

   This function analyzes the input image to identify regions where the
   curvature changes, indicating the presence of cavities. It computes
   vertical and horizontal differences in pixel values to detect edges and
   applies a threshold to filter out insignificant changes. The resulting
   areas are then processed to remove any chunks that do not meet the
   minimum criteria for cavity detection. The function returns a list of
   valid chunks that represent the detected cavities.

   Search for edges in an image using a pencil strategy.

   This function implements an edge detection algorithm that simulates a
   pencil-like movement across the image represented by a 2D array. It
   identifies white pixels and builds chunks of points based on the
   detected edges. The algorithm iteratively explores possible directions
   to find and track the edges until a specified condition is met, such as
   exhausting the available white pixels or reaching a maximum number of
   tests.

   :param o: An object containing parameters such as min, max coordinates, cutter
             diameter,
             border width, and optimisation settings.

   Build a stroke array based on start and end points.

   This function generates a 2D stroke array that represents a stroke from
   a starting point to an ending point. It calculates the length of the
   stroke and creates a grid that is filled based on the positions defined
   by the start and end coordinates. The function uses a cutter array to
   determine how the stroke interacts with the grid.

   :param start: A tuple representing the starting coordinates (x, y, z).
   :type start: tuple
   :param end: A tuple representing the ending coordinates (x, y, z).
   :type end: tuple
   :param cutterArray: An object that contains size information used to modify
                       the stroke array.

   Generate a toolpath for a milling operation using a crazy stroke
   strategy.

   This function computes a path for a milling cutter based on the provided
   parameters and the offset image. It utilizes a circular cutter
   representation and evaluates potential cutting positions based on
   various thresholds. The algorithm iteratively tests different angles and
   lengths for the cutter's movement until the desired cutting area is
   achieved or the maximum number of tests is reached.

   :param o: An object containing parameters such as cutter diameter,
             optimization settings, movement type, and thresholds for
             determining cutting effectiveness.

   This function implements a strategy for milling by navigating through a
   binary image. It starts from a defined point and attempts to move in
   various directions, evaluating the cutter load to determine the
   appropriate path. The algorithm continues until it either exhausts the
   available pixels to cut or reaches a predefined limit on the number of
   tests. The function modifies the input array to represent the areas that
   have been milled and returns the generated path as a list of chunks.

.. py:function:: getResolution(o)

   Calculate the resolution based on the dimensions of an object.

   This function computes the resolution in both x and y directions by
   determining the width and height of the object, adjusting for pixel size
   and border width. The resolution is calculated by dividing the
   dimensions by the pixel size and adding twice the border width to each
   dimension.

   :param o: An object with attributes `max`, `min`, `optimisation`,
             and `borderwidth`. The `max` and `min` attributes should
             have `x` and `y` properties representing the coordinates,
             while `optimisation` should have a `pixsize` attribute.
   :type o: object

   :returns:

             This function does not return a value; it performs calculations
                 to determine resolution.
   :rtype: None


.. py:function:: _backup_render_settings(pairs)

   Backup the render settings of Blender objects.

   This function iterates over a list of pairs consisting of owners and
   their corresponding structure names. It retrieves the properties of each
   structure and stores them in a backup list. If the structure is a
   Blender object, it saves all its properties that do not start with an
   underscore. For simple values, it directly appends them to the
   properties list. This is useful for preserving render settings that
   Blender does not allow direct access to during rendering.

   :param pairs: A list of tuples where each tuple contains an owner and a structure
                 name.
   :type pairs: list

   :returns:

             A list containing the backed-up properties of the specified Blender
                 objects.
   :rtype: list


.. py:function:: _restore_render_settings(pairs, properties)

   Restore render settings for a given owner and structure.

   This function takes pairs of owners and structure names along with their
   corresponding properties. It iterates through these pairs, retrieves the
   appropriate object from the owner using the structure name, and sets the
   properties on the object. If the object is an instance of
   `bpy.types.bpy_struct`, it updates its attributes; otherwise, it
   directly sets the value on the owner.

   :param pairs: A list of tuples where each tuple contains an owner and a structure
                 name.
   :type pairs: list
   :param properties: A list of dictionaries containing property names and their corresponding
                      values.
   :type properties: list


.. py:function:: renderSampleImage(o)

   Render a sample image based on the provided object settings.

   This function generates a Z-buffer image for a given object by either
   rendering it from scratch or loading an existing image from the cache.
   It handles different geometry sources and applies various settings to
   ensure the image is rendered correctly. The function also manages backup
   and restoration of render settings to maintain the scene's integrity
   during the rendering process.

   :param o: An object containing various properties and settings
   :type o: object

   :returns: The generated or loaded Z-buffer image as a NumPy array.
   :rtype: numpy.ndarray


.. py:function:: prepareArea(o)
   :async:


   Prepare the area for rendering by processing the offset image.

   This function handles the preparation of the area by rendering a sample
   image and managing the offset image based on the provided options. It
   checks if the offset image needs to be updated and loads it if
   necessary. If the inverse option is set, it adjusts the samples
   accordingly before calling the offsetArea function. Finally, it saves
   the processed offset image.

   :param o: An object containing various properties and methods
             required for preparing the area, including flags for
             updating the offset image and rendering options.
   :type o: object


.. py:function:: getCutterArray(operation, pixsize)

   Generate a cutter array based on the specified operation and pixel size.

   This function calculates a 2D array representing the cutter shape based
   on the cutter type defined in the operation object. The cutter can be of
   various types such as 'END', 'BALL', 'VCARVE', 'CYLCONE', 'BALLCONE', or
   'CUSTOM'. The function uses geometric calculations to fill the array
   with appropriate values based on the cutter's dimensions and properties.

   :param operation: An object containing properties of the cutter, including
                     cutter type, diameter, tip angle, and other relevant parameters.
   :type operation: object
   :param pixsize: The size of each pixel in the generated cutter array.
   :type pixsize: float

   :returns: A 2D array filled with values representing the cutter shape.
   :rtype: numpy.ndarray
