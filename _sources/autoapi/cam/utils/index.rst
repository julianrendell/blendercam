   :value: True


.. py:function:: opencamlib_version()

   Return the version of the OpenCamLib library.

   This function attempts to import the OpenCamLib library and returns its
   version. If the library is not available, it will return None. The
   function first tries to import the library using the name 'ocl', and if
   that fails, it attempts to import it using 'opencamlib' as an alias. If
   both imports fail, it returns None.

   :returns: The version of OpenCamLib if available, None otherwise.
   :rtype: str or None


.. py:function:: positionObject(operation)

   Position an object based on specified operation parameters.

.. py:function:: getOperationSources(o)

   Get operation sources based on the geometry source type.

   This function retrieves and sets the operation sources for a given
   object based on its geometry source type. It handles three types of
   geometry sources: 'OBJECT', 'COLLECTION', and 'IMAGE'. For 'OBJECT', it
   selects the specified object and applies rotations if enabled. For
   'COLLECTION', it retrieves all objects within the specified collection.
   For 'IMAGE', it sets a specific optimization flag. Additionally, it
   determines whether the objects are curves or meshes based on the
   geometry source.
