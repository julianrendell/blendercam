.. py:function:: finger(diameter, stem=2)

   Create a joint shape based on the specified diameter and stem.

   This function generates a 3D joint shape using Blender's curve
   operations. It calculates the dimensions of a rectangle and an ellipse
   based on the provided diameter and stem parameters. The function then
   creates these shapes, duplicates and mirrors them, and performs boolean
   operations to form the final joint shape. The resulting object is named
   and cleaned up to ensure no overlapping vertices remain.

   :param diameter: The diameter of the tool for joint creation.
